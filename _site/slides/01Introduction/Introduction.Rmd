# The term no one really defined

- What is data science?

> Data science is the discipline of making data useful.  Ok...so what is it?

# Three tracks of data science

- Engineering (infrastructure and production): the process of making everything else possible 

- Analysis: the process of turning raw information into insights in a fast way

- Modeling/Inference: the process of diving deeper into the data to discover the pattern we don't easily see


(It is a group work from https://github.com/brohrer/academic_advisory/blob/master/authors.md !)

# Engineering

(1) Data environment: data storage, Kafka platform, Hadoop and Spark cluster etc.

(2) Data management:  parsing the logs, web scraping, API queries, and interrogating data streams. 

(3) Production: integrate model and analysis into the production system


# Analysis

(1) Domain knowledge

(2) Exploratory analysis

(3) Story telling

# Modeling

(1) Supervised learning

(2) Unsupervised learning

(3) Customized model development

# General Process of Modeling/Analytics

# Some confusions and more to come

- **Data infrastructure engineer**: _Go,Python, AWS/Google Cloud/Azure, logstash, Kafka, and Hadoop_
- **Data engineer**: _spark/scala, python, SQL, AWS/Google Cloud/Azure, Data modeling_
- **BI engineer**: _Tableau/looker/Mode etc, data visulization, SQL, Python_ 
- **Data analyst**: _SQL, basic statistics, data visualization_
- **Data scientist**: _R/Python, SQL, basic + applied statistics, data visualization, experimental design_
- **Research scientist**: _R/Python, advanced statistics + experimental design, ML, research background, publications, conference contributions, algorithms _
- **Applied scientist**: _Similar to research scientist, ML algorithm design, often with an expectation of basic software engineering skills_
- **Machine Learning Engineer**: _More advanced software engineering skillset, algorithms, machine learning algorithm design, system design_

# Types of Questions (Modeling/Analytics)

- Comparison: 
    - Are males more inclined to buy our products than females?
    - Are there any differences in customer satisfaction in different business districts?
    - Do soybean carrying a particular gene have higher oil content?

- Description:
    - Is the distribution of annual income normal?
    - Are there outliers?
    - What are the means of different customer segments?

- Clustering:
    - Which customers have similar product preference? 
    - Which printer performs similar pattern to the broken ones?
    - How many different themes are there in the corpus?

# Types of Questions (Modeling/Analytics)

- Classification:
    - Who is more likely to buy our product?
    - Is the borrower going to pay back?
    - Is it a spam?

- Regression:
    - What will be the temperature tomorrow?
    - What is the projected net income for the next season?
    - How much inventory should we have?
