title: Data Science Workshop
subtitle: Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Big Data
description: |
    Data can be a valuable asset, especially when there’s a lot of it. 
    Exploratory data analysis, business intelligence, 
    and machine learning can benefit tremendously if such big data 
    can be wrangled and modelled at scale. 
    Apache Spark is an open-source distributed engine for 
    querying, processing and modeling big data. 
    In this one-day workshop, you will learn how to leverage 
    Spark and R/Python to process and model big data with 
    common machine learning algorithm. By the end of this workshop, 
    you will have a solid understanding of how to process big data using 
    Spark and how to build common machine learning models in the cloud environment. 
    You will also learn the motivation and use cases of deep learning through
    hands-on exercises.  <br/>

    This workshop is designed for audience with statistics education background. 
    This course bridges the gap between traditional statisticians and data scientists. 
    No software download or installation is needed, everything is done through 
    laptop’s internet browser (Chrome or Firefox) with Databricks free cloud environment.
